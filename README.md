# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
Using the provided credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we are tasked to perform of all the machine learning models outlined in this module. These include oversampling the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. In addition we'll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Finally, we'll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. We'll be using the results to evaluate the performance of these models and write a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit card risk.
